## Tasks
Overview over the completed tasks

### Interactive Environment 
Design a small, walkable 3D environment optimized for VR. The environment should consist of at least three different interactive objects (e.g., doors that can be opened, lights that can be switched on and off, or objects that can be picked up and placed).

### VR Controls
Integrate VR controls that allow movement within the environment and interaction with it. Ensure that the controls are intuitive and optimized for the VR experience.

### Performance 
Optimize the application for smooth performance in VR, with a stable framerate target of 90 FPS on a mid-range VR-ready PC.

Due to the lack of a working vr headset the tasks were executed for a first person controller instead.
